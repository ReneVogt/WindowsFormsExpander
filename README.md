# Windows Forms Expander
### An Expander control for Windows Forms.

---
This library provides the `Expander` control class, a Windows Forms container
control with a header that can be collapsed or expanded.

In this example you can see two `Expander` controls in a `GroupBox` (with their `Dock` property set to `Top` to let the layout rearrange the lower `Expander` when the upper is expanded or collapsed). For demonstration purposes the two `Expander`s contain `PropertyGrid`s, but you can add any child controls you like.
